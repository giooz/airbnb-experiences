## Description

Project developed along the "Learn React" webcourse at Scrimba.com, recreating a landing page of AirBnb Experiences.

In this project, I learned more about the reusability of a React component, with the introduction of the props concept, and also reviewed array/object manipulation in JS.

Finally, I also learned how to create a local React project using the 'npx create-react-app'.
